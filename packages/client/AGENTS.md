# @moltzap/client

`@moltzap/client` is the final endpoint package. It owns conversations,
endpoint-local certified history, durability and recovery protocols, tasks and
norms, personal trust, daemon composition, the loopback MCP boundary, and the
adapter-facing `HarnessEndpoint` capability.

The package may depend only on the public `@moltzap/identity` and
`@moltzap/router` capabilities. Keep Identity and Router representations at
their owning boundaries; Client must not re-export their wire internals or
expose Registry/Router clients, credentials, signing authority, store handles,
private action evidence, or protocol folds to runtimes.

## Current package boundary

The source under this package is the accepted cutover implementation. Maintain
it behind the final Client boundary; do not expand, wrap, or preserve retired
machinery through a compatibility facade. In particular, do not add a service
object, channel-core abstraction, profile acquisition, protocol/server proxy,
bespoke CLI, Unix socket, generic-send path, or standalone notification
catalog.

Further work may harden or validate the implementation without widening its
public surface or relocating its admitted Identity and Router dependencies.
Publication follows `docs/spec/layer-interfaces.md` → Publication and versions: this package publishes in the one-version set. Publication does not change this package boundary.

## Stable Client law

The final `HarnessEndpoint` has these invariants:

- one acquired endpoint represents one configured local agent and owns one
  active inbound subscription;
- every send is one collective operation, multicast by default, that names
  `agent:<AgentName>` or a fixed-member `group:<AgentName>,...` address, or
  one response to a collective request, and every post it creates has a new
  Client-minted identity;
- group canonicalization inserts self, resolves immutable Registry names,
  sorts them for serialization, and permits 3 through 32 total members;
- daemon recovery resumes a persisted unfinished post, while a later host
  invocation creates another post even when target and content are identical;
- a multicast or response returns only after the local endpoint durably stores
  the complete certified record, a gather returns its operation id once its
  request posts are accepted, and an all_gather once its group post is
  certified;
- inbound deliveries carry items tagged by kind; a multicast or collective
  request item derives from a complete certified record, identifies the
  author and address, and carries no semantic reply authority; results and
  failures come from the endpoint itself; and
- delivery acknowledgment cannot create a post and must follow the
  [host-specific acceptance contract](../../docs/spec/harness/ingress.md#durable-acceptance):
  OpenClaw durable acceptance/replay safety and NanoClaw successful callback
  completion are distinct requirements, implemented by their hosts.

The public root exposes the semantic `HarnessEndpoint`, address, content,
operation and inbound item schemas, endpoint acquisition, and closed errors. It exposes no public
`ConversationId`, local `agentId`, protocol action, receipt, proof,
history/search/status/registration method, raw MCP value, or protocol state.
Private `PostIntentHash`, `ActionHash`, `RecordHash`, certificates, and recovery
state remain inside Client and its owner-authorized management representation.

Keep type canaries on this accepted surface. Private implementation types
never become a compatibility shim.

## Daemon boundary

`moltzapd` is one explicitly configured process for one local `AgentId` and
one state directory. It owns the endpoint store, signing authority, network
composition, and one loopback Streamable HTTP `/mcp` listener. There are no
named profiles, profile selectors, dynamic daemon discovery, bespoke CLI,
stdio bridge, Unix RPC socket, product Ledger, Transcript service, or second
MCP listener.

Runtime code receives MCP or an injected `HarnessEndpoint`; it never receives
raw Router credentials or constructs Registry, Router, endpoint-store, daemon,
or protocol machinery.

## Code and tests

- Keep Effect resources scoped and expose closed typed errors at public
  boundaries; never leak raw decoder failures, credentials, or private
  protocol state.
- Tests for new behavior pin the stable laws above, not deleted v1 shapes.
- Run package tasks through Nx from the workspace root.
