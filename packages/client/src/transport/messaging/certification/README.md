# Messaging certification

This directory certifies posts. It selects the Router-ordered proposal at
each predecessor, signs and collects action and durability evidence, and
promotes a record once its certificates reach quorum. When a verified POST
record whose action certificate meets `q(n)` names another proposal at a
locked predecessor, it releases that lock and locks the record's action
without signing it. It also resumes the dissemination of certified records
that the store still owes to peers.

Start with `index.ts`. It accepts Router and recovery ingress, resumes folds
at startup and as each conversation recovers, and re-exports the dissemination
resume and the evidence-to-fold match `../startup.ts` uses. `evidence.ts`
routes a stable evidence message to the fold it names and verifies it.
`dissemination.ts` re-queues each durable dissemination obligation. Both are
private to this directory; the engine binds the operations other phases start
through `EngineRuntime.phases`.
