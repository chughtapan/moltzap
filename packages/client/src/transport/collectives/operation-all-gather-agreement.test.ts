/**
 * @file Pins all_gather agreement: under every schedule the harness draws,
 * the requester and each honest member publish one result, the same one, and
 * it holds exactly the answers the requester's first close lists.
 *
 * One group conversation is modelled as a single certified chain that every
 * endpoint reads in order, skipping its own records, as the store delivers
 * them. A schedule interleaves at random: each endpoint's deliveries, a
 * member's answer being started, certified into the chain and returned to the
 * member as three separate steps, the deadline, a redelivery of the record
 * an endpoint last classified (a failed acknowledgment), and the posts of a
 * dishonest member `dave` (two answers and a close of his own) and of a
 * dishonest requester (a second close). The coverage counters make the
 * test fail when the draw stops reaching the interleavings it exists for.
