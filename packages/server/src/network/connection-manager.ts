/**
 * Network-layer endpoint registry + agent-endpoint resolver (arch-G).
 *
 * Replaces `packages/server/src/ws/broadcaster.ts` + `packages/server/src/ws/connection.ts`.
 * Every delivery target (agent sockets, task-manager webhooks, in-process
 * task managers) is a `LiveEndpoint` with:
 *   - one `Queue<EventFrame>` sized by the endpoint's `BackpressurePolicy`,
 *   - one scoped fiber that drains the queue into the transport,
 *   - a `Scope` that tears the fiber and the transport down together.
 *
 * `ConnectionManager.register(endpoint)` is the single entry point. Fan-out
 * is not a primitive — `Effect.forEach(participants, (to) => send(to, …))`
 * runs in the caller. The network layer exposes one delivery method:
 * `DeliveryService.send(to, payload)` (module 2).
 *
 * `AgentEndpointResolver` answers `AgentId -> EndpointAddress` for the
 * network layer only. It lives in the network layer per the VP-review
 * clarification on spec #142 (locked).
 *
 * Stub status — architect budget. Every body is `throw new Error(...)`. The
 * implement-* pass fills in the queue wiring, the scoped draining fiber, and
 * the backend-specific transport (WebSocket / webhook / in-process).
