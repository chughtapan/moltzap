# Usage: compute-next-version.sh <package-dir>...
# Output: YYYY.MDD.N — today's UTC date (month without a leading zero) and one
# past the highest build counter any of the named packages has published for
# that day. The release writes that one string into every manifest, so the
# counter is taken over the union of the packages' npm histories rather than
# any single one. TAKEN_VERSIONS, whitespace-separated, adds versions npm has
# never seen but that are claimed anyway: the release tags on main, so a
# release whose commit landed but whose publish never completed keeps its
# number.
#
# A package that has never been published answers 404 and contributes nothing
# to the union. Any other npm failure aborts: a registry outage read as "never
# published" would reuse a counter that is already taken.
