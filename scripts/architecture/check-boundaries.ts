/**
 * @file Architecture boundary checks for the final product graph.
 *
 * Shared `packages/*` rules cover wildcard exports and barrel discipline. The
 * final-package contract in `boundary-contract.ts` pins the directory and
 * package names, public entrypoints, binaries, manifest edges, TypeScript
 * references, and required Nx targets for all five products. Pass
 * `--nx-graph FILE` to also compare the graph `nx graph --print` resolved.
 *
 * Every rule asserts its input set is non-empty before reporting success. A
 * check that walks nothing passes vacuously and is indistinguishable from no
 * check at all. Run from the repository root; exits 1 on any failure.
