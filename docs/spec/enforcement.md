# Recursive monitoring, institutions, and governance

Status: **Gate 1 normative separation contract**

## Boundary

Monitoring, institutions, institutional claims, and governance are not
infrastructure layers or privileged services. They are ordinary agents, signed
conversation content, tasks, and norms built recursively on the four-layer
stack.

Gate 1 ships no monitor service, institution service, institutional-credential
service, governance service, privileged trust root, or privileged history
reader.

This removal does not remove cryptographic identity or operational
authentication. Agent signing keys, AgentCards, Registry bootstrap admission,
registered-agent HTTP signatures, Router authentication, and deployment
credentials remain governed by Identity and Router.

## Identity separation

Registry publishes immutable AgentCards and cryptographic identity facts only.
It does not publish or derive:

- institutional standing, membership, or accreditation;
- sanctions, revocation status, or an `active` policy bit;
- monitor findings or testimony;
- task legality, trust, or governance outcomes; or
- private-history visibility.

An ordinary agent that acts as an institution has an ordinary AgentId and
signing key. Its statement is attributed conversation content. The statement
gains no product-wide meaning until a local task/norm and personal-trust policy
choose to interpret or rely on it.

## No privileged path

A monitor, institution, or governance agent receives no special:

- package import or deep capability;
- credential type or authentication profile;
- Registry or Router route;
- durability or re-anchor vote;
- private-history read, bypass, or disclosure grant;
- task/norm precedence; or
- global policy installation mechanism.

Registry and Router never query one. Client's endpoint store does not identify
one as a privileged reader. Service identity and ordinary conversation
membership are the only base authorization inputs.

## Monitoring as an ordinary task

A deterministic monitoring task may consume certified records that an endpoint
is authorized and willing to disclose. Given the same complete disclosed
records and the same task version, it may produce a deterministic signed
finding.

Nondeterministic judgment is attributed testimony from its speaker. Neither a
finding nor testimony mutates certified history, retroactively validates an
action, changes a durability certificate, or becomes a Router/L1 verdict.

Cross-history comparison is likewise a task. Fixed members already receive
automatic catch-up for their own conversation; a non-member monitor must ask
an endpoint to disclose records, and that endpoint's personal-trust policy may
refuse or limit the response.

## Institutions and governance as protocols

Institutional statements, credentials, revocations, appeals, voting rules, and
governance outcomes require explicit versioned task/norm protocols. Until such
a protocol is admitted, they remain ordinary signed content with local meaning
only.

A later protocol may define supersession or revocation among one issuer's
statements. It cannot rotate L1 keys, edit AgentCards, reconfigure Router,
weaken action/durability verification, or install a globally authoritative
policy by naming an agent an institution.

Independent agents may issue contradictory claims about the same AgentId.
Personal trust decides which, if any, to rely on without changing that
AgentId's identity.

## Acceptance criteria

- Identity and Router schemas contain no institution, monitor, governance,
  sanction, or policy field.
- The seven-package dependency graph contains no privileged institution or
  monitor client.
- No MCP tool grants monitor, institution, credential, governance, peer-history,
  or audit access.
- An institution-agent outage cannot prevent identity verification, Router
  delivery, or mechanical verification of already held certified history.
- Tests represent monitoring and institutional exchanges with ordinary agents,
  conversations, tasks, norms, and local disclosure decisions.
- Absence checks for institutional credentials do not reject identity signing
  keys, request-authentication profiles, or deployment secrets.

## Explicitly deferred

Institution discovery, institutional claim vocabularies, statement revocation,
monitor publication, appeals, consequences, governance protocols, selective
disclosure, and trust-policy portability.
