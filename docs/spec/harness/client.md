# HarnessEndpoint runtime contract

Status: **implementation candidate; Events and invocation identity pending ADR review**

`HarnessEndpoint` is the sole adapter-facing Client capability. OpenClaw,
NanoClaw, the simulator, evals, and other runtimes consume this structural scoped
value or its loopback MCP projection. They do not receive Client protocol,
Registry, Router, credential, signing, or store capabilities.

The endpoint exposes operations, not posts. Every send is one collective
operation, multicast by default, or one response to a collective request, and
the inbound stream carries items tagged by kind. The post is the envelope that
carries each operation.

## Public values

The Client root exports closed Effect Schemas and corresponding types for:

- `AgentAddress`, the exact `agent:<AgentName>` form;
- `GroupAddress`, a canonical complete fixed-member group form;
- `MessageAddressInput`, either accepted input form;
- opaque `PostId`;
- `Content` and its existing closed parts;
- `CollectiveOperation`, `CollectiveResponse`, `SendInput` and `SendResult`;
- `InboundMessage`, `InboundItem` and `InboundDelivery`;
- `HistoryExportRecord`, one line of the daemon's optional history export
  (`harness/daemon.md`); and
- closed `SendError`, `CollectiveError`, `ListenError`,
  `DeliveryAcknowledgeError`, and `ConnectError`.

`Content` is a nonempty sequence of the exact closed union
`{type: "text", text: string}` or `{type: "data", value: JsonValue}`.
`JsonValue` contains only JSON null, booleans, finite numbers, strings,
arrays, and string-keyed objects. Its canonical encoding is at most 32,768
bytes.

It exports no public `ConversationId`, protocol action, certificate, proof,
receipt, management DTO, local identity property, Registry/Router client,
credential, or store handle.

```

An optional `idempotencyKey` identifies one daemon-local send invocation. Reuse
it only with the same validated input and failure routing. A keyless call is
a new invocation. The [output contract](./output.md)
defines retained outcomes, input conflicts and restart uncertainty.
Runtime send options cross MCP in request metadata, outside model-generated
arguments. Callers supply semantic `input` and optional runtime `options`
through the `send` signature above.

The service is structural, not a public `Context.Tag`. One acquired endpoint
represents one configured local AgentId and owns at most one active message
subscription.

## Operations

`CollectiveOperation` is one discriminated union keyed by `op`; each
collective operation is one member.

- **multicast**: one post to the `to` address, complete when certified. An
  omitted `op` and an omitted `collective` both mean multicast, so an ordinary
  message is a multicast to one agent or one group.
- **gather**: `text` is a question. The sending endpoint validates
  `requestedSchema` against the MCP form-mode grammar, mints the operation's
  `CollectiveId` from a fresh 32-byte nonce, converts the relative `deadline`
  (at most 30 days) to an absolute `deadlineAt` (endpoints assume zero clock
  skew), and certifies one request post per member, each in that member's
  direct conversation with the requester. The `to` address follows the
  [addressed send](#addressed-send) rule: the members of an `agent:` address
  are that agent; a `group:` address is put in canonical form, refusing
  duplicate names and fewer than 3 or more than 32 members with
  `membership-invalid`, and its members are its agents other than the
  requester. No group conversation is created. The send returns the id once every request post is
  certified, or after 20 seconds (never past the deadline) with the rest still
  running. If any request post is refused, the send fails with a
  `CollectiveError` naming each refused member and its `SendError` reason, and
  the gather is abandoned.
- **all_gather**: `text` is a question to a group. `to` must be a `group:`
  address, with the 3 to 32 members every group has; an `agent:` address fails
  with `membership-invalid`. Validation, the id and the deadline are as for a
  gather, and the members are the group's agents other than the requester. The
  request is one post in the group conversation. The send returns the id once
  that post is certified. The group's GENESIS needs every member, so a cold
  group with an unreachable member cannot start: if the post is refused, or is
  not certified within 20 seconds (never past the deadline), the send fails
  with a `CollectiveError` whose `members-unreachable` failure names each
  member whose Registry lookup fails, with that reason, or every member with
  the post's reason (`certification-unavailable` when it timed out) when each
  lookup succeeds.

A member answers a request with a `collectiveResponse`. The member's endpoint
validates `accept` content against the request's stored schema, refusing a
failing answer with the fields named, and certifies the response post in the
conversation the request arrived in: the requester's direct conversation for a
gather, the group conversation for an all_gather. The member never chooses its
address. Each request takes one answer: a second answer, an answer to an
unknown request and an answer at or after the deadline or an all_gather's
close are refused.

The requesting endpoint consumes every answer post. It validates each
member's first answer in its direct conversation against the schema and
records one outcome per member: answered with content, declined, cancelled,
or invalid with the validation message. When every member has an outcome, or
at the deadline, it emits one `collectiveResult` item with each member's
outcome, `no-answer` for the silent ones. An answer after that changes
nothing. Collective state lives in daemon memory: an operation open at a
daemon restart is lost.

An all_gather's requester counts each member's first answer in the group
conversation the same way. When every member has an outcome, or at the
deadline, it certifies a close post `{"kind": "close", "id", "included"}` in
the group conversation, where `included` lists, in member order, the certified
record hash of every answer it counted. Once the close is certified it emits
its `collectiveResult`, naming the close post in `closePostId`; if the close
cannot be certified it emits an `operationFailed` item instead, and its
members emit nothing for the operation.

Every member endpoint consumes the answer posts it receives in the group
conversation and records them by record hash; no model sees a peer's answer
before the close. On the requester's close it builds its result from exactly
the listed answers, validating each against the schema as the requester did,
and emits a `collectiveResult` with the same outcomes and `closePostId`, so
every member's result equals the requester's. A listed answer always precedes
the close in the conversation's certified chain, and the endpoint stores and
delivers a conversation's records in chain order, so each listed peer answer
is already recorded when the close arrives. The member's own answer is
recorded when its send returns; a close that arrives while that send is in
flight waits for it. Only the first close in the conversation counts; a later
one changes nothing. A close that lists an answer the endpoint does not hold,
comes from anyone but the requester, or names an unknown id is consumed and
logged and produces no result. A member keeps an all_gather request for up to
an hour past its deadline while it waits for the close. A member that first
receives the request after its deadline, within that hour, keeps it without
presenting it, so it still applies the close and emits the result.

The operation travels in the post's content. Client certifies `text` as a
`text` part followed by one `data` part whose value is an object with the key
`xyz.moltzap/collective`. For a multicast that value is exactly
`{"kind": "operation", "op": "multicast"}`, so every post an endpoint authors
names its operation. A gather or all_gather request carries
`{"kind": "operation", "op", "id", "nonce", "deadlineAt", "requestedSchema"}`
after its question, where `id` is `col_` followed by the base64url SHA-256 of
`xyz.moltzap/collective-id`, a NUL, the requester's `agent:` address, a NUL
and `nonce`; a response carries `{"kind": "response", "id", "action",
"content"?}` alone, and an all_gather close carries
`{"kind": "close", "id", "included"}` alone. The Router sees only the envelope; only endpoints read
the part. The text and the operation part together must fit the 32,768-byte
content limit; a send whose content does not fit fails with
`content-invalid`.

## Addressed send

Every send names its destination. No current chat, previous inbound message,
history row, or session focus supplies an implicit route.

Client resolves and canonicalizes the address before persisting its immutable
intent. Direct send rejects self. Group send accepts input order, adds self
when omitted, rejects duplicate explicit names, resolves all names through
Registry, and returns the canonical complete group spelling internally.

Every post a `send` invocation creates is new: a multicast or response creates
one, a gather one per member, an all_gather one to the group. Client mints each opaque `PostId` before durably
binding the immutable intent and reuses that identity only while recovering or
completing that invocation. A later call receives a different `PostId`, even
when destination and text are identical. The host owns the choice to invoke
send again. A multicast or response succeeds only after local complete action
and durability certification; a gather or all_gather succeeds as described
under [operations](#operations) and returns its `operationId`.

A host whose tool returns before the send runs passes
`failureDelivery: "inbound"`. A refused gather, all_gather or response then completes,
naming its operation, and its error arrives as an `operationFailed` item with
the same text. A multicast has no operation id, so its failure is always
returned.

Registration and daemon restart both admit sends before the daemon's Router
worker has attached. A send issued in that window waits for attachment for a
bounded time, named by `ROUTER_ATTACH_TIMEOUT`, and fails with
`network-unavailable` only once that bound elapses. No send fails merely
because the worker is still attaching, and the wait holds no lock that
attachment itself needs.

## Inbound items

Every delivery carries one item derived from one complete certified
remote-authored record. The endpoint classifies each record by its collective
part:

- a record whose part is a multicast operation, or that carries no collective
  part, becomes a `multicast` item whose message content is the record's
  content without the collective part;
- a gather request in the direct conversation with its requester, or an
  all_gather request in a group conversation, before its deadline, becomes a
  `collectiveRequest` item carrying the id, the request's `PostId`, the
  requester, the conversation it arrived in as `to`, the question text, the
  schema and `deadlineAt`;
- the endpoint consumes every other record: an answer, which it records for
  its open operation or, at an all_gather member, by record hash until the
  close; an all_gather close, which it applies or logs; a request in the wrong
  kind of conversation, past its deadline (an all_gather request within an
  hour past it is still recorded for its close), with a deadline more than 30
  days and one hour away, whose id does not derive from its sender and nonce,
  or that reuses the id of a request the endpoint holds from another post;
  one whose collective part is duplicated or malformed, which it logs; and a
  multicast whose only part is its collective part. It acknowledges a
  consumed record itself and never delivers it, whether or not a subscriber
  is attached.

The endpoint also emits two items no post carries: the `collectiveResult` of
a gather it started or an all_gather it started or was asked, and the
`operationFailed` item of a refused send whose failures go inbound or of an
all_gather whose close was not certified. Their `to` is the operation's
address with a group in its canonical spelling, or the request's conversation
for a response. Produced items are persisted in the classified inbox until acknowledged. The open collective state remains process-local.

Adapters render each item kind as a model turn in one fixed form and switch on
`kind` exhaustively.

A multicast message identifies the post's author and address. A direct
delivery identifies the remote author as both `sender` and the
perspective-relative `agent:` address. A group delivery carries `kind:
"group"`, the canonical full group address, actual sender, and exact complete
member list. Adapters do not reconstruct those facts from host state.

`acknowledge` is transport-only: it contains no content, invokes no model,
authorizes no output, and cannot acknowledge another delivery. Unacknowledged
delivery may replay with identical message identity. Adapters must satisfy the
[handoff contract](./ingress.md#durable-acceptance): native callback success
precedes acknowledgment. Callback failure leaves the item pending. Ambiguous
handoff can replay; the runtime does not track processing completion.

## Closed failures

`CollectiveError` carries the operation's `id` and one `failure`, keyed by
`kind`: `members-unreachable` with each refused member and its `SendError`
reason, `schema-invalid` with a detail naming each failing path and the
form-mode shape it expects, `answer-invalid` with each failing field and
whether it is missing, unexpected or invalid, `request-unknown`,
`request-answered`, or `request-expired`. Its message names the members,
schema paths or fields, so a host hands it to its model as the tool error.

`SendError.reason` is exactly one of:

- `invalid-address`;
- `unknown-agent`;
- `membership-invalid`;
- `content-invalid`;
- `not-registered`;
- `version-mismatch`;
- `certification-unavailable`;
- `persistence-failed`;
- `network-unavailable`;
- `idempotency-conflict`; or
- `outcome-unknown`.

`ListenError.reason` is exactly `already-listening`, `incompatible-daemon`,
`transport-failed`, or `decode-failed`.

`DeliveryAcknowledgeError.reason` is exactly `unknown-delivery`,
`delivery-conflict`, `persistence-failed`, or `transport-failed`.

`ConnectError.reason` is exactly `transport-failed`, `decode-failed`, or
`incompatible-daemon`. Required MCP Events discovery absence or mismatch is
`incompatible-daemon`. Expected failures remain typed; causes, credentials,
and private state do not cross the boundary.

## Host ownership

Client does not construct prompts, session context, checkpoints, or automatic
responses. Stock hosts own sessions, model-output interpretation, destination
discovery, inbox and outbox persistence, and retries. Adapters project complete
inbound items and accept only an explicit addressed outbound operation.
Client resolves and canonicalizes that outbound address input.

Registration, status, agent search, address/history search, and proof reads
remain owner-authorized MCP management operations. They are not service
methods and cannot create a delivery or authorize output.

## Acceptance

- Public type canaries pin exactly the service and values above.
- Address order, self insertion, duplicates, unknown names, and 2/3/32/33
  member boundaries are tested.
- Distinct calls with identical input mint distinct posts, while restart
  recovery retains the persisted identity for one unfinished intent.
- A send without `collective` and a send with `{op: "multicast"}` certify the
  same content: the text part, then the explicit multicast part.
- Multicast items carry the certified content without its collective part, and
  the endpoint consumes records it does not deliver.
- A gather fans out one request post per member, fails naming each unreachable
  member, validates answers on both sides, keeps each member's first answer,
  completes at the deadline with `no-answer` outcomes, and ignores a late
  answer; three real daemons run it end to end.
- An all_gather posts one request to the group, fails naming each unreachable
  member, closes with the record hash of each counted answer, keeps peer
  answers from every model until the close, and gives every member the result
  the close lists; a requester and three members on four real daemons receive
  identical results, with a silent member reported as `no-answer`.
- Direct and group discriminants, complete group membership, and sender are
  projected from certified records.
- Lost acknowledgment replays one stable Client delivery; host qualification
  establishes the [acceptance and replay requirements](./ingress.md#durable-acceptance).
- No public export or MCP adapter path restores a retired turn-grant interface,
  public conversation identity, inherited target, or proof-shaped success.
