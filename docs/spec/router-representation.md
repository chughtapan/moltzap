# L2 Router representation

{/* @bake-constants: V2_PROTOCOL_VERSION */}

Status: **Gate 1 normative**

Semantic contract: [`router.md`](./router.md)

This chapter owns the exact Router representation. The `router` package
uses L1 AuthenticatedHttp and SignedMessage without exporting their
mechanisms.

## Canonical JSON

Every Router request and result body uses RFC 8785 JCS UTF-8 bytes.
Effect Schema is the only JSON parser. The HTTP boundary enforces the
route-specific received-body cap, then AuthenticatedHttp uses
`Schema.parseJson()` plus the identity-owned depth and Unicode
refinements and requires byte equality with the JCS encoding of the
parsed value. It returns the authenticated caller, verified AgentCard,
and inner `request` value. The Router-owned closed Effect Schema then
decodes that inner value as the selected operation request. It does not
parse the bytes again or repeat identity resolution.

Unknown members, duplicate members, trailing data, byte-order marks,
lone surrogate code points, and alternate number spellings are
rejected. Objects shown below use readable key order; their bytes use
JCS key order.

The maximum decoded JSON container depth is 16. A root object or array
has depth 1, each nested object or array adds 1, and scalar values add
no depth. A decoder rejects excess depth before constructing a semantic
value. This Gate 1 bound is not deployment-configurable.

## Refined values

| Value | Exact JSON string |
|---|---|
| `RouterInstanceId` | `rti_` plus the 22-character canonical unpadded base64url encoding of 16 bytes |
| `SignedMessageDigest` | `smd_` plus the 43-character canonical unpadded base64url encoding of 32 bytes |
| `PollCursor` | `plc_` plus the exact Compact JWE below |

The base64url rejection rules in `identity-representation.md` apply at
the L2 boundary and are repeated by Router-owned decoders. The three
values are nominally distinct.

`SignedMessageDigest` is SHA-256 over the UTF-8 JCS bytes of the
complete SignedMessage General JWS object, prefixed as specified above.
It is an equality receipt for one retained live entry, not an order or
delivery proof.

## PollCursor

PollCursor is an opaque client-held value. After removing `plc_`, the
remainder is one Compact JWE with five base64url segments.

The protected header JCS value is exactly:

```json
{
  "alg": "dir",
  "enc": "A256GCM",
  "typ": "application/vnd.moltzap.poll-cursor+jwe"
}
```

There is no JWE unprotected header, shared header, recipient header,
additional authenticated data, compression, key ID, or extension
member. `alg: dir` uses the process's random 256-bit key directly.
`enc: A256GCM` uses a fresh 96-bit IV for every cursor encryption and a
128-bit authentication tag. The Compact JWE encrypted-key segment is
empty as required by `dir`.

The encrypted plaintext is the JCS UTF-8 representation of exactly:

```json
{
  "agentId": "agt_<22-character-base64url>",
  "routerInstanceId": "rti_<22-character-base64url>",
  "lastScannedOrder": "0"
}
```

`lastScannedOrder` matches `0|[1-9][0-9]*` and its decoded value is at
most `2^128 - 1`. It has no sign, leading zero, whitespace, exponent,
fraction, or numeric JSON representation. The decimal is a private
Router value and never leaves the encrypted plaintext. Order `0` is
the empty-tail sentinel, the first accepted SignedMessage has order
`1`, and later accepted messages increment by one within the process
instance.

The protected header, two fixed-width identifiers, unsigned 128-bit
order, IV, and authentication tag bound a complete prefixed PollCursor
to at most 348 ASCII characters.

Compact-JWE parse failure, noncanonical protected header or plaintext,
authentication failure, wrong caller or instance, an order above the
unsigned 128-bit range, future order, and a previous process key all
become `cursor_invalid`.

## Authenticated request envelope

Send and poll use the exact normal AuthenticatedHttp profile from
`identity-representation.md`. Their outer body is:

```json
{
  "callerAgentId": "agt_<22-character-base64url>",
  "request": {}
}
```

`callerAgentId` is both the HTTP-authentication identity and the poll
recipient. For send it must also equal the verified SignedMessage
sender.

Requests use `Content-Type: application/json`,
`MoltZap-Version: 2026.729.1`, exact Content-Digest, and the
`moltzap-request-v1` HTTP message-signature profile. Application code
imposes no URL scheme or TLS requirement.

The `kind` field is the common closed-union discriminator already used
by L1. Every well-formed, authenticated, version-matched request that
reaches a Router domain outcome without owner overload or an
infrastructure failure returns status 200 with one closed result.
Envelope, overload, and infrastructure failures use the status and
exact `{"error":"..."}` bodies in
`identity-representation.md`.

## Representation limits

Identity fixes the decoded opaque-body maximum at 262,144 bytes and
the SignedMessage recipient maximum at 128. Its closed SignedMessage
representation derives a maximum complete General JWS JCS encoding of
471,671 bytes. Router consumes that identity-owned maximum; it does not
reproduce the General JWS size calculation.

Router derives one received-body cap from each closed authenticated
request representation:

| Route | Maximum received body |
|---|---:|
| `POST /v1/messages:send` | 471,819 octets |
| `POST /v1/messages:poll` | 422 octets |

The poll cap admits the maximum 348-character PollCursor. The maximum
complete one-message `batch`, including a maximum PollCursor, is
472,119 UTF-8 JCS bytes.

These five enclosing maxima are representation consequences, not
operator-selected configuration:

- maximum complete SignedMessage: 471,671 bytes;
- maximum send request: 471,819 octets;
- maximum PollCursor: 348 ASCII characters; and
- maximum poll request and one-message result: 422 octets and 472,119
  bytes respectively.

The HTTP reader rejects a route body above its own cap before parsing.
SignedMessage validation independently enforces the identity-owned
artifact maximum after the request Schema decodes. Poll-result
construction counts UTF-8 JCS bytes of the complete result, including
its PollCursor, and stops before the first addressed SignedMessage that
would exceed the configured result-byte limit. Overflow-checked
calculators are tested against the actual Schema, JCS, and JWE
encodings owned by Router.

## Send

`POST /v1/messages:send`

The exact body is:

```json
{
  "callerAgentId": "agt_<22-character-base64url>",
  "request": {
    "expectedRouterInstanceId": "rti_<22-character-base64url>",
    "mode": "initial",
    "signedMessage": {}
  }
}
```

`mode` is exactly `initial` or `retry`. `signedMessage` is the complete
General JWS object specified by `identity-representation.md`.

The exact results are:

```json
{
  "kind": "accepted",
  "routerInstanceId": "rti_<22-character-base64url>",
  "signedMessageDigest": "smd_<43-character-base64url>"
}
```

```json
{
  "kind": "router_restarted",
  "routerInstanceId": "rti_<22-character-base64url>"
}
```

```json
{"kind":"message_invalid"}
```

```json
{"kind":"idempotency_conflict"}
```

```json
{"kind":"retry_identity_unknown"}
```

`message_invalid` collapses every post-authentication SignedMessage
shape, binding, key, digest, signature, recipient, and fixed or derived
message-bound failure. It carries no reason.

## Poll

`POST /v1/messages:poll`

An initial anchor has the exact body:

```json
{
  "callerAgentId": "agt_<22-character-base64url>",
  "request": {}
}
```

A continuation has:

```json
{
  "callerAgentId": "agt_<22-character-base64url>",
  "request": {
    "pollCursor": "plc_<compact-jwe>"
  }
}
```

The exact results are:

```json
{
  "kind": "batch",
  "routerInstanceId": "rti_<22-character-base64url>",
  "signedMessages": [],
  "pollCursor": "plc_<compact-jwe>"
}
```

```json
{
  "kind": "feed_gap",
  "routerInstanceId": "rti_<22-character-base64url>"
}
```

```json
{"kind":"cursor_invalid"}
```

`signedMessages` contains complete SignedMessage General JWS objects in
the restriction of Router's private global order to the authenticated
caller. It may be empty only for an initial anchor or continuation
timeout.

`cursor_invalid` has no RouterInstanceId. `feed_gap` has no partial
batch or PollCursor. The Router returns `feed_gap` exactly when the
decoded `lastScannedOrder` is less than its greatest-evicted order,
which starts at `0`; equality does not create a gap.

## Health

`GET /healthz` returns:

- 204 with no body when locally ready; or
- 503 with no body when not ready.

It requires no MoltZap version or request signature and reveals no
Registry status.

## Envelope failure mapping

Before a domain result, Router uses the exact AuthenticatedHttp order
and mapping:

| Status | Exact body |
|---:|---|
| 400 | `{"error":"malformed"}` |
| 401 | `{"error":"authentication_failed"}` |
| 404 | `{"error":"not_found"}` |
| 405 | `{"error":"method_not_allowed"}` |
| 412 | `{"error":"version_mismatch"}` |
| 413 | `{"error":"payload_too_large"}` |
| 415 | `{"error":"unsupported_media_type"}` |
| 429 | `{"error":"overloaded"}` |
| 503 | `{"error":"unavailable"}` |
| 500 | `{"error":"internal"}` |

Registry lookup infrastructure failure during AuthenticatedHttp
verification is 503 `unavailable`. A missing identity is an
authentication failure at the L1 boundary.
